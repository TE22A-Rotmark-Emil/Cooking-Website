            <h3>Step 1: Clean up</h3>
            <p>Take half the brown sugar, mix it in a large bowl alongside all the salt.</p>
            <p>Throw this concoction out the window.</p>
            <p>Mix in the rest of the brown sugar into the same large bowl that you just threw out.</p>
            <p>Spend the $75 on a window repair.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Prepare the meat</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Ensure that all the meat is entirely free of parasites. You never know.</li>
                <li>Clear your kitchen of any germs. Any and all germs must be exterminated. It is possible that germs could have a negative / positive impact on the quality of the red meat.</li>
                <li>Once complete, ensure that you have a safe space to be in. This would ideally be a nuclear shelter, though, in the event of one not being readily available, a bedroom will suffice. You never know.</li>
                <li>Assuming both previous steps went smoothly, leave the safe space. Once you've done so, you must, with as much caution as deemed necessary, do your laundry. Remember to wash your hands before you do your laundry. You may also wash them after.</li>
                <li>If all previous steps worked adequately, put the red meat on a stove. No pan necessary.</li>
